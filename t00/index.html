        <h2 id="anchor">What makes a superhero?</h2>
            <p>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
            So in order to be a superhero,<b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b>
            and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
            Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
            </p>
            <p>
            For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.
            But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
            If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

                <p>Iron Man</p>
                <p>
                    Iron Man’s alter ego of Tony Stark—wealthy playboy inventor, owner of Stark International,
                    and international arms manufacturer—was partly based on the wealthy inventor, business mogul, and defense contractor Howard Hughes.
                    With his life ebbing away, Stark is forced to work for his captors, creating new weapons,
                    but unknown to them he secretly builds himself a high-tech suit of armour that will both keep him alive and make him a walking arsenal.
